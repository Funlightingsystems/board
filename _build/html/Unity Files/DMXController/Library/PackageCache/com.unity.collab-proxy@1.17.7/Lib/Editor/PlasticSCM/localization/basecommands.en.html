RECURSIVE MERGE: This is a recursive merge. It means there are multiple ancestors instead of just one.
Plastic SCM will solve it automatically merging the multiple common ancestors to create a single one that will be used to merge the source and the destination contributors.</p>
<p>Now you are merging the ancestor {0} with ancestor {1}, and it will generate a virtual ancestor vcs:{2} that will be used later.</p>

<p>== EncryptionConfigurationExplanation ==
The ‘{0}’ source server requires data encryption.
Your server (aka ‘{1}’) is not yet configured to handle encrypted data from it.</p>
<p>Remarks:
* Be very careful with the encryption password; it’s the only way to decrypt your data on ‘{0}’.
* If you’re decrypting data and you enter a wrong password, the data will fail to decrypt and you will have to edit cryptedservers.conf on your server to fix it.
* Be careful to use the same password (encryption key) company-wide to work with ‘{0}’. Otherwise, data will be encrypted differently in each server.</p>
<p>Enter a password to generate the encryption key (leave empty to cancel):</p>
<p>== EncryptionPasswordNotEntered ==
You didn’t entered a password. Encryption won’t be configured for server ‘{0}’.</p>
<p>== EncryptionConfigurationFailed ==
Failed to configure encryption for server ‘{0}’.</p>
<p>== EncryptionConfigurationSucceeded ==
Encryption configuration added for server ‘{0}’.</p>
